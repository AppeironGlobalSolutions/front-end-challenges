# Real-Time Chat Application
==========================

Welcome to the ultimate real-time chat application! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to send and receive messages in a group chat or private chat. You'll use a library like Socket.io to implement the real-time communication, and use React hooks to manage the application's state and display the chat messages.

## Requirements
------------

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1.  Allow users to sign up for an account and log in to the chat application.

2.  Allow users to create and join group chat rooms, or send private messages to other users.

3.  Use Socket.io or a similar library to implement real-time communication between users, including sending and receiving chat messages.

4.  Use React hooks to manage the application's state, including storing the list of chat rooms, the list of messages in each room, and the user's online status.

5.  Use React hooks to display the chat messages and the online status of other users in the chat room.

6.  Use a library like React Bootstrap or Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the chat messages and other information in a clear and concise way.

## Bonus Features
--------------

As a bonus, you can try to implement the following features:

1.  Allow users to send and receive images and other media in the chat.

2.  Implement a "dark mode" feature that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme.

3.  Use the Geolocation API to detect the user's location and display it to other users in the chat room.

4.  Allow users to customize their chat profiles, including their username, avatar, and status message.

5.  Use the HTML5 Notifications API to send desktop notifications when the user receives a new message while the chat application is not in focus.
