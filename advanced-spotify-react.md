# Music Player Application
========================

Welcome to the ultimate music player application! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to search for and play songs from a music library. You'll use the Spotify API to retrieve song data, and use React hooks and the `fetch` function to make the API call. You'll also use a library like React Howler to play the songs and control the playback.

## Requirements
------------

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1.  Allow users to search for songs by artist, album, or track name.

2.  Display a list of songs that match the search criteria, including the song name, artist, album, and album artwork.

3.  Allow users to play, pause, and skip songs, and control the volume of the playback.

4.  Use React Howler or a similar library to play the songs and control the playback.

5.  Use React hooks to manage the application's state, including storing the search results, the current song, and the playback status.

6.  Use React hooks and the `fetch` function to make API calls to the Spotify API to retrieve song data.

7.  Use a library like React Bootstrap or Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the song data and playback controls in a clear and concise way.

## Bonus Features
--------------

As a bonus, you can try to implement the following features:

1.  Allow users to create and save playlists of their favorite songs.

2.  Implement a "dark mode" feature that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme.

3.  Use the Spotify API's recommendation feature to suggest similar songs to the user.

4.  Use the Spotify API's audio analysis feature to display the song's tempo, key, and other metadata.

5.  Implement a "shuffle" feature
