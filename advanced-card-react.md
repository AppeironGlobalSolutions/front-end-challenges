# Card Game Application
=====================

Welcome to the ultimate card game application! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to play a simple card game against an AI opponent. You'll use React Redux to manage the game state, and use React hooks to update the UI and handle user input. You'll also use a library like Minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search to implement the AI logic.

## Requirements
------------

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1.  Implement a simple card game with a small deck of cards, such as War or Go Fish.

2.  Use React Redux to manage the game state, including storing the deck of cards, the hands of the player and the AI, and the current game phase.

3.  Use React hooks to update the UI and handle user input, including displaying the cards in the player's hand and allowing the player to make moves.

4.  Implement the AI logic using a library like Minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search, to allow the AI to make intelligent decisions based on the current game state.

5.  Use a library like React Bootstrap or Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the cards and other game information in a clear and concise way.

## Bonus Features
--------------

As a bonus, you can try to implement the following features:

1.  Allow users to play against multiple AI opponents, each with a different difficulty level.

2.  Implement a "dark mode" feature that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme.

3.  Use the HTML5 Audio API to play sound effects during the game, such as when a card is played or when the game ends.

4.  Implement a multiplayer mode that allows users to play against other players online.

5.  Use React Router to create a route for a "leaderboard" page, where users can view the top scores and rankings for the game.
