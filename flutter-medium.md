# Flutter Mobile Developer Challenge

## Objective
Develop a simple mobile application that displays a list of articles from a mock API and allows users to view article details. This challenge evaluates your skills in using BLoC for state management, implementing clean code practices, and applying hexagonal architecture in a Flutter application.

## Requirements

1. **Architecture**:
   - Use hexagonal architecture to structure the application, separating concerns into distinct layers (e.g., domain, data, and presentation).
   - Implement dependency injection to manage dependencies.

2. **State Management**:
   - Use the BLoC pattern for managing the application's state.
   - Ensure that the state management solution is scalable and maintainable.

3. **Features**:
   - Fetch and display a list of articles from a mock API (you can use JSONPlaceholder or any other mock API service).
   - Implement a detail view to show more information about a selected article.
   - Provide a simple UI that adheres to Material Design guidelines.

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use the latest version of Flutter and Dart.
   - Implement network requests using `http` or `dio` packages.
   - Write unit tests for BLoCs and data layer logic.
   - Follow clean code principles, ensuring code is well-organized, readable, and maintainable.

## Bonus (Optional)

- **Offline Access**: Implement caching of articles to allow offline access using a local database like `sqflite` or `hive`.
- **Real-time Updates**: Simulate real-time updates using streams to handle changes in the article list.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a "dark mode" toggle in the app settings.
- **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages using Flutter's internationalization capabilities.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Source Code**: Host the code in a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
- **Documentation**: Provide a README file with instructions on how to run the application, any architectural decisions made, and any challenges faced during development.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Code quality and adherence to clean code principles
  - Proper implementation of BLoC and state management
  - Effective use of hexagonal architecture
  - Functionality and UI/UX design
  - Quality and coverage of tests

## Timeline

- You have 4 to 6 hours to complete this challenge. Please submit your solution by the end of the deadline.
