# Recipe Search Application
=========================

Welcome to the ultimate recipe search application! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to search for recipes by ingredient, cuisine, or other criteria. You'll use the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data, and use React hooks and the `fetch` function to make the API call. You'll also use a library like React Virtualized to efficiently display large lists of recipes.

## Requirements
------------

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1.  Allow users to search for recipes by keyword, ingredient, cuisine, dietary restriction, or other criteria.

2.  Display a list of recipes that match the search criteria, including the recipe name, image, and a brief description.

3.  Use React Virtualized to efficiently display large lists of recipes, including lazy loading, windowing, and virtualization.

4.  Use React Router to create a route for a recipe detail page, where users can view additional information about the selected recipe, such as the ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

5.  Use React Redux to manage the application's state, including storing the search criteria and the list of recipes.

6.  Use React hooks and the `fetch` function to make API calls to the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data.

7.  Use a library like React Bootstrap or Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the recipe data in a clear and concise way.

## Bonus Features
--------------

As a bonus, you can try to implement the following features:

1.  Allow users to save their favorite recipes to a "Favorites" list.

2.  Implement a "dark mode" feature that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme.

3.  Use the Geolocation API to detect the user's location and display recipes that use ingredients that are in season in that location.

4.  Allow users to filter the recipe list by prep time, cook time, and other criteria.

5.  Use the Spoonacular API's recipe recommendation feature to suggest similar recipes to the user.
