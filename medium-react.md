# Weather Forecast Application
============================

Welcome to the ultimate weather forecast application! In this challenge, you'll build an application that allows users to see the current weather for any location around the world. You'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data, and use Axios to make the API call. You'll also use a library like Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the weather data in a clear and concise way.

## Requirements
------------

To complete this challenge, your application should meet the following requirements:

1.  Allow users to search for the weather by city name, zip code, or latitude and longitude coordinates.

2.  Display the current weather for the selected location, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sky conditions.

3.  Display the weather forecast for the next few days, including the high and low temperatures, the chance of precipitation, and the wind speed.

4.  Use React Router to create routes for different pages in the application, such as a home page, a search page, and a forecast page.

5.  Use React Redux to manage the application's state, including storing the current location and the forecast data.

6.  Use Axios to make API calls to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data.

7.  Use a library like Material UI to create a visually appealing user interface that displays the weather data in a clear and concise way.

## Bonus Features
--------------

As a bonus, you can try to implement the following features:

1.  Use React Router to create a route for a "favorite locations" page, where users can save and view the weather for their favorite locations.

2.  Implement a "dark mode" feature that allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme.

3.  Use the Geolocation API to automatically detect the user's current location and display the weather for that location.

4.  Allow users to switch between different temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin).

5. Build the solution using TypeScript and Airbnb ESLint
